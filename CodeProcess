**Process of the CodeClause Internship Stock Market Prediction Project:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - The project starts by collecting historical stock price data for a predefined list of Nifty 50 companies from Yahoo Finance.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The collected data is loaded from a CSV file.
   - Users are presented with a list of available company symbols and names to choose from.
   - Users select a specific company symbol and a prediction date.

3. **Creating Sequences for LSTM:**
   - Time series data is divided into sequences suitable for training the LSTM model.

4. **Building the LSTM Model:**
   - An LSTM neural network model is constructed using the Keras library.
   - The model architecture consists of LSTM layers followed by dense layers, suitable for time series prediction.

5. **Callbacks Setup:**
   - Callbacks like early stopping and model checkpointing are configured to monitor and improve training.

6. **Model Training:**
   - The LSTM model is trained using historical stock price data.
   - Hyperparameters such as the number of epochs and batch size are defined for training.

7. **Making Predictions:**
   - The trained model is used to make predictions for the selected company's stock price on the specified prediction date.
   - Predictions are transformed back to the original price scale for meaningful interpretation.

8. **Calculating Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Evaluation metrics including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) are calculated to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

9. **Results Visualization:**
   - Visualizations are generated to display the training and validation loss over epochs.
   - Actual vs. predicted stock prices are plotted to visualize the model's performance.

10. **GitHub Repository:**
    - The project code, including the script and README.md, is hosted on a GitHub repository for easy sharing and collaboration.

11. **User Interaction:**
    - Users can run the script, select a company, and observe predictions interactively.

12. **Contribution and Licensing:**
    - The repository encourages contributions from others.
    - The project is licensed under the MIT License to allow for open collaboration.

This project enables users to gain insights into stock price prediction using LSTM neural networks and provides a practical example of time series forecasting in financial markets.
